## Overview

Shade Sanctuary is a theme for Obsidian MD, originally designed to create an enjoyable environment for writing and working with educational content. Inspired by [Castel's lecture notes](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/) and CyanVoxel's [Vauxhall theme](https://github.com/CyanVoxel/vauxhall-obsidian), Shade Sanctuary blends the academic feel with colorful visuals.

## Customization

You can customize Shade Sanctuary by installing the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin. This allows you to select various color schemes for your interface, ranging from red to purple. Additionally, you can adjust the intensity of your interface, whether you prefer it brighter or completely dark. Note that these changes only affect the dark theme for the time being.

For further customization, you can install [Elevict's snippets](https://github.com/Elevict/Elevict-Snippets). These snippets include features like mathematics callouts, gradient callouts and headers, animated elements, and much more.
